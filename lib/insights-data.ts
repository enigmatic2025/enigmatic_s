      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">Recently I came across an article in The Conversation titled "The Doorman Fallacy: Why Careless Adoption of AI Backfires So Easily." It captured something I've seen in many businesses today: the belief that if a job can be described simply, it can be automated, and that this will automatically improve efficiency.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-medium text-foreground mt-14 mb-6">The Doorman Example</h3>
      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">The article gives a great example. Imagine a hotel owner trying to cut costs and increase profits. He decides to eliminate the doorman position because, on paper, it seems unnecessary. A machine can open doors, after all. But this overlooks what the doorman contributes. He greets guests, helps with luggage, creates a welcoming atmosphere, and represents the hotel's character and hospitality. His work is about experience, safety, and connection, not just opening a door.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">That is the essence of the "doorman fallacy": simplifying a complex human role into a narrow task, automating it, and assuming the business will improve, without considering the hidden value that gets lost.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-medium text-foreground mt-14 mb-6">Current Mistakes in AI Adoption</h3>
      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">Many organizations today are making similar mistakes. They rush to replace employees with offshore teams or automation, driven by the excitement around artificial intelligence. Some even reduce staff despite being profitable, believing AI will handle everything more efficiently. But many leaders do not fully understand what they are replacing, or what they are losing in the process.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-medium text-foreground mt-14 mb-6">The Reality of AI Tools</h3>
      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">Large language models (LLMs) are impressive tools, but they are far from perfect. The most capable models are expensive to operate, while smaller ones struggle with complex reasoning. Bigger models can generate better results, but they also bring problems like inaccurate answers, unpredictable behavior, and vulnerability to misleading inputs.</p>

      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">Despite what some technology experts claim, the AI field is still young. Most of us are learning as we go. Each new generation of models introduces new strengths and new challenges, and entire systems must be redesigned to integrate them safely. Good AI implementation requires careful planning, thoughtful prompts, continuous monitoring, and human oversight.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-medium text-foreground mt-14 mb-6">What Research Shows</h3>
      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">Recent research supports this point. A report from McKinsey & Company found that almost every major company now invests in AI, yet only one percent believe they have reached full maturity, meaning AI is deeply integrated and delivering measurable business outcomes.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">Similarly, a 2025 study by Boston Consulting Group found that only five percent of more than 1,200 global companies are realizing clear business value from AI, such as reduced costs or improved workflows. Most organizations, about sixty percent, have seen little to no benefit.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-medium text-foreground mt-14 mb-6">The Path Forward</h3>
      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">These findings show that while AI holds great promise, success depends on more than technology. It requires new strategies, redesigned workflows, cultural change, and a focus on people.</p>

      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">Looking ahead, businesses should focus on partnership rather than replacement. The goal is not to remove humans from the process but to combine human strengths with AI tools in a way that enhances both. The doorman fallacy reminds us to ask, before automating a role, what else that person contributes. What value might disappear if they are gone?</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-base text-secondary-foreground">AI can transform how we work, but only if human insight, empathy, and judgment remain central. It is not "AI versus human," but "human plus AI" working together so that the technology supports people rather than replacing them without understanding the consequences.</p>
