# Enigmatic & Nodal Business Context

## Enigmatic

Enigmatic is the parent company and service provider. We are not just a "logistics tech" company in the sense of providing a single tool like an ELD or TMS. We are experts in connecting systems and optimizing business processes.

**Services:**

1.  **Consulting**: Strategic advice on logistics operations, technology stack, and process improvement.
    - **Engineering**: Implementation and custom development services.
    - **Connectivity**: We have deep expertise in connecting disparate systems (like EDI providers, TMS, and internal tools) to create a unified ecosystem.

## Nodal

Nodal is the proprietary business process platform built by Enigmatic. It is designed to facilitate business processes, allowing for connections and event triggers that orchestrate work across your entire stack.

**Core Concept:**

- **Action Flows**: Workflows (pipelines) that allow users to do their job consistently.
- **Orchestration**: Connects disparate systems (TMS, EDI, HRIS, etc.) and automates tasks outside of the core TMS.
- **Action Types**:
  - **Workflow Action**: Automated steps executed by the system.
  - **AI Action**: Tasks performed by AI agents (e.g., document parsing, decision making).
  - **Human Action**: Tasks requiring human-in-the-loop intervention (e.g., review, approval, exception handling).
- **Designer Interface**: A visual tool resembling a mix of Lucidchart and automation platforms like n8n or Sim.ai.

**Execution:**

- Workflows are triggered by specific events (webhooks, emails, status changes) or schedules.
- Execution involves a collaborative effort between the backend system, human operators, and AI agents.

**Value Proposition:**

- **Standardization**: Ensures business processes are followed strictly by all users.
- **Connectivity**: Acts as the glue between systems (e.g., connecting Orderful to your TMS and internal tools).
- **Monitoring & Measurement**: Provides visibility into process performance and bottlenecks.
- **Automation**: Reduces manual effort where possible, specifically for tasks that fall "between the cracks" of major systems.
